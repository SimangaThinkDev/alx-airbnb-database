# Database Optimization Changes
This document summarizes the recent database optimization efforts for the booking system schema.

### 1. Query Performance Optimization
Initial Query Analysis: A complex query retrieving booking, user, property, and payment details was analyzed using EXPLAIN to identify performance bottlenecks.

Indexing for Joins: To improve join performance, an index was recommended for Booking.user_id (if not already present), complementing existing foreign key indexes.

Indexing for Filtering: For queries involving WHERE clauses (e.g., filtering by status and start_date), a composite index on Booking (status, start_date) was suggested to enable efficient filtering and partition pruning.

### 2. Table Partitioning
Objective: To enhance query performance on the large Booking table, especially for date-range queries.

Implementation: The Booking table was re-created with RANGE partitioning based on YEAR(start_date). This involves dropping and recreating all related tables due to MySQL's foreign key constraints when the partitioning column is not part of the primary key.

Benefits: Partitioning enables partition pruning, allowing the database to scan only relevant data segments for date-filtered queries, significantly reducing I/O and improving execution times.

These changes aim to ensure the database remains performant and scalable as data volumes grow.
